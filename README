Frozen-Flask
------------

Freezes a Flask application into a set of static files. The result can be hosted
without any server-side software other than a traditional web server.

See documentation: http://packages.python.org/Frozen-Flask

I've modified this version for use with Git. The build process will ignore your .git folder and .gitignore files. This makes it easier to deploy via a Git-based process, e.g. for use with Github Pages.
