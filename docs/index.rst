Frozen-Flask
============

Frozen-Flask freezes a `Flask`_ application into a set of static files.
The result can be hosted without any server-side software other than a
traditional web server.

.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/

**Note:** This project used to be called Flask-Static.

Installation
------------

Install the extension with one of the following commands::

    $ easy_install Frozen-Flask

or alternatively if you have pip installed::

    $ pip install Frozen-Flask

or you can get the `source code from github
<https://github.com/SimonSapin/Frozen-Flask>`_.

Configuration
-------------

To get started all you need to do is to instantiate a :class:`.Freezer` object
after configuring the application::

    from flask import Flask
    from flaskext.frozen import Freezer
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_pyfile('mysettings.cfg')
    freezer = Freezer(app)

Frozen-Flask accepts the following configuration values:

``FREEZER_DESTINATION``
    Path to the directory where to put the generated static site. If relative,
    interpreted as relative to the application root, next to the ``static`` and
    ``templates`` directories. Defaults to ``build``.

``FREEZER_BASE_URL``
    Full URL you application is supposed to be installed at. This affects
    the output of :func:`flask.url_for` for absolute URLs (with 
    ``_external=True``) or if your application is not at the root of its
    domain name.
    Defaults to ``'http://localhost/'``.

``FREEZER_OVERWRITE``
    If set to `True`, Frozen-Flask will remove files in the destination
    directory that were not built during the current freeze. This is intended
    to clean up output files no longer needed on followup calls to
    :meth:`Freezer.freeze`. Defaults to `True`.

URL generators
--------------

The extension work by simulating requests to your application. These requests
are done at the WSGI level. This allow a behavior similar to a real client,
but bypasses the HTTP/TCP/IP stack.

This, the extension needs a list of URLs to request. It can get by with
URL rules that take no arguments and static files (both of which can be
disabled, see :ref:`api`) but you’ll need to help it for everything else.

To do so, register URL generators. A generator is a callable that take no
parameter and return an iterable of URL strings, ``(endpoint, values)``
tuples as for :func:`flask.url_for`, or just a ``values`` dictionary.
In the last case, ``endpoint`` defaults to the name of the generator function,
just like with Flask views.::

    @app.route('/')
    def products_list():
        return render_template('index.html', products=models.Product.all())

    @app.route('/product_<int:product_id>/')
    def product_details():
        product = models.Product.get_or_404(id=product_id)
        return render_template('product.html', product=product)

    @freezer.register_generator
    def product_urls():
        for product in models.Product.all():
            yield 'product_details', {'product_id': product.id}

    # This URL generator is the same as the one above. Generating the same URL
    # more than once is okay, they are de-duplicated.
    @freezer.register_generator
    def product_details():
        for product in models.Product.all():
            # `endpoint` is implicitly the name of the function: product_details
            yield {'product_id': product.id}


Note that the view and the generator have the same name. **TL;DR: that’s okay.**
Having two functions with the same name is generally a bad practice but
causes no problem here as the functions are only used by their decorators.
For non-trivial apps you probably want to have a module for views and
another one for URL generators anyway.

Once everything is configured, run the build::

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        freezer.freeze()

As loading files directly in a web browser does not play well with some URLs,
(browsers do not show ``index.html`` for directories, and absolute path may
have a different meaning, ...) you can also start a server to check that
everything is fine before uploading::

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        freezer.freeze()
        freezer.serve()

`Flask-Script <http://packages.python.org/Flask-Script/>`_ may come in handy
here.

.. _mime-types:

Filenames and MIME types
------------------------

For each generated URL, Frozen-Flask simulates a request and save the content
in a file in the ``FREEZER_DESTINATION`` directory. The filename is
built from the URL. URLs with a trailing slash are interpreted as a directory
name and the content is saved in ``index.html``.

Additionally, the extension checks that the filename has an extension that
match the MIME type given in the ``Content-Type`` HTTP response header.

For example, the following views will both fail::

    @app.route('/lipsum')
    def lipsum():
        return '<p>Lorem ipsum, ...</p>'

    @app.route('/style.css')
    def compressed_css():
        return '/* ... */'

as the default ``Content-Type`` in Flask is ``text/html; charset=utf-8``, but
the MIME types guessed by the Frozen-Flask as well as most web servers from the
filenames are ``application/octet-stream`` and ``text/css``.

This can be fixed by adding a trailing slash to the URL or serving with the
right ``Content-Type``::

    @app.route('/lipsum/')
    def lipsum():
        return '<p>Lorem ipsum, ...</p>'

    @app.route('/style.css')
    def compressed_css():
        return '/* ... */', 200, {'Content-Type': 'text/css; charset=utf-8'}

Character encodings
-------------------

Flask uses Unicode everywhere internally, and defaults to UTF-8 for I/O.
It will send the right ``Content-Type`` header with both a MIME type and
and encoding (eg. ``text/html; charset=utf-8``). Frozen-Flask will try to
`preserve MIME types <#mime-types>`_ through file extensions, but it can not
preserve the encoding meta-data. You may need to add the right
``<meta>`` tag to your HTML (you should anyway).

Flask also defaults to UTF-8 for URLs. Since Frozen-Flask chooses the name of
the files it builds from URLs, filenames are UTF-8 too. As links in your HTML
have the same encoding, it should Just Work™. If it doesn’t, please `report
a bug <https://github.com/SimonSapin/Frozen-Flask/issues>`_.

Changelog
---------

Version 0.4, released on 2011-06-02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Bugfix: correctly unquote URLs to build filenames. Spaces and non-ASCII
  characters should be %-encoded in URLs but not in frozen filenames. (Web
  servers do the decoding.)
* Add a documentation section about character encodings.

Version 0.3, released on 2011-05-28
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* URL generators can omit the endpoint and just yield ``values`` dictionaries.
  In that case, the name of the generator function is used as the endpoint,
  just like with Flask views.
* :meth:`Freezer.all_urls` and :func:`walk_directory` are now part of the
  public API.

Version 0.2, released on 2011-02-21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Renamed the project from Flask-Static to Frozen-Flask. While we’re at
breaking API compatibility, :func:`flaskext.static.StaticBuilder.build`
is now :func:`flaskext.frozen.Freezer.freeze` and the prefix for configuration
keys is ``FREEZER_`` instead of ``STATIC_BUILDER_``.
Other names were left unchanged.

Version 0.1, released on 2011-02-06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First properly tagged release.
